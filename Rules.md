# Coup Game Rules

## Overview
Coup is a card game of bluffing and deduction for 2-6 players. Players are nobles in a corrupt government, trying to eliminate their opponents' influence while protecting their own. The last player with any influence remaining wins.

## Components
- **Character Cards**: 15 cards total, 3 each of 5 characters:
  - Duke
  - Assassin
  - Captain
  - Ambassador
  - Contessa
- **Coins**: 50 coins (represented by tokens or paper money).

## Setup
1. Shuffle the 15 character cards to form the Court Deck.
2. Deal 2 cards face down to each player. These represent their influence.
3. Give each player 2 coins.
4. Place the remaining cards face down in the center as the Court Deck.
5. Determine the first player (e.g., youngest player or by agreement).

## Gameplay
Players take turns in clockwise order. On your turn, you must perform one action. Actions can be challenged or blocked by other players.

### Basic Actions (No Character Required)
- **Income**: Take 1 coin from the treasury. Cannot be challenged or blocked.
- **Foreign Aid**: Take 2 coins from the treasury. Can be blocked by a Duke.
- **Coup**: Pay 7 coins to the treasury and choose another player to lose an influence (they discard one card face down). Cannot be challenged or blocked. This action is mandatory if you have 10 or more coins at the start of your turn.

### Character Actions (Claim a Character)
- **Tax** (Duke): Take 3 coins from the treasury. Can be challenged.
- **Assassinate** (Assassin): Pay 3 coins to the treasury and choose another player to lose an influence. Can be blocked by a Contessa.
- **Steal** (Captain): Take 2 coins from another player. Can be blocked by a Captain or Ambassador.
- **Exchange** (Ambassador): Draw 2 cards from the Court Deck, look at them, and exchange any number of them with cards from your hand. Return the remaining drawn cards to the deck. Can be challenged.

### Challenging
- If you suspect a player does not have the character they claimed for their action, you may challenge them.
- The challenged player must reveal one of their cards. If it matches the claimed character, the challenger loses an influence (discards a card face down) and the challenger draws a new card from the Court Deck. If it does not match, the challenged player loses that influence and draws a new card.
- You may only challenge if you have at least one card remaining.

### Blocking
- Some actions can be blocked by claiming a specific character:
  - Foreign Aid can be blocked by Duke.
  - Assassinate can be blocked by Contessa.
  - Steal can be blocked by Captain or Ambassador.
- Blocks can also be challenged in the same way as actions.

### Losing Influence
- When you lose influence, discard one card face down. You are out of the game when you have no cards left.
- If the Court Deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile to form a new Court Deck.

### Winning
- The last player with at least one card (influence) remaining wins the game.
- In a 2-player game, the player who eliminates the other's last influence wins.

## Strategy Tips
- Bluffing is key: You can lie about your cards to deceive opponents.
- Pay attention to what cards have been revealed or discarded to deduce what others might have.
- Manage your coins carefully to avoid being forced into a Coup.
